      <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white">
        Hey, nice seeing you here! I'm a nerdy software engineer from the
        Philippines who can do fullstack development with a preference and
        love for creating interesting frontends.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white">
        Becoming a developer was something I already had in mind since the
        time I wrote my first HTML when I was 13. That was way back in 2011.
        I've been programming for quite a while now. Sheeesh!
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white">
        There's something about coding that always intrigues me. It feels
        like solving a puzzle or building legos.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white">
        Anyways, let's get into the good stuff! YEEAAHH!
